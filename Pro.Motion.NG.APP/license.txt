	The end-user is responsible for using appropriate hard- and software environment as
	required by the software.

	apply (warranty).
	
	In case of defects in the software or the associated documentation and upon notifcation by the end-user,
    Cosmigo will initially provide warranty by providing a new software with the defect being removed.
	The notification of a defect shall always be in writing.
	
    If Cosmigo is not willing or can not provide a new software replacement or if the action will be delayed
	beyond the reasonable period agreed upon with the end-user or if the action will fail due to any other reasons,
	the end-user shall be entitled to withdraw from the contract or may insist on a reduction of the license price. 
	Withdrawing or reduction of price may only apply if Cosmigo has been given enough opportunity for
    removing the defect without the desired result. Cosmigo may try to remove the defect by delivering
	new software twice.
    The right of the end-user to claim for damages under §437 of the German Civil Code (BGB) remains unaffected.
    
	The limitation period for all claims for damages is determined by legal provisions
    and begins with the delivery or providing/granting of the license.
    
	This warranty does not apply to software that has been provided to the end-user
    free of charge. Cosmigo is then not obligated to remove any defects or
    to pay compensation if the license is free of charge. With a license free of charge
	the software is provided "AS IS".
	
    Cosmigo is not liable for any damages, which arise due to omitting the
    installation of provided updates.

    period for the rest of the warranty period.
	 
	This warranty does not apply to software that has been provided to the end-user
    free of charge. Cosmigo is then not obligated to remove any defects or
    to pay compensation if the license is free of charge. With license free of charge
	the software is provided "AS IS".

10. Final Provisions
Any further agreements that extend this agreement shall be in writing.
If any provisions of this contract prove ineffective, unenforceable or violate law,

purpose and shall apply from the beginning of the ineffectiveness.

endangering the purpose of this contract, the contracting partners commit themselves,
under consideration of the intended purpose, to interpret, to correct or to replace the
contract with another effective and enforceable provision so that its commercial and
legal purpose may be attained.
